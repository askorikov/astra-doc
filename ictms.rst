ASTRA Toolbox workshop at ICTMS 2019
====================================

We will teach an ASTRA workshop on 22 July 2019 at `ICTMS 2019 <http://ictms2019.org/>`_ in Australia.

This workshop will consist of two 90-minute parts which can be attended either separately or together.

There will be ample opportunity to ask questions. If you bring a laptop with ASTRA already installed (GPU not necessary), there will be the opportunity to do a few hands-on exercises to get started with using ASTRA at the end of each session.

Closer to ICTMS, we will update this webpage with any other relevant information, including how to set up ASTRA on your laptop for the hands-on parts of the workshop.

Registration is required on the `ICTMS Workshops page <http://ictms2019.org/workshop.php>`_.
